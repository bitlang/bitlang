# Bit Code Structure
Bit code is typically laid out in the following structure:
* **Shebang comment:** This tells Bit to interpret this file as code. It also allows direct execution at the command line.
* **Imports:** This allows Bit files to use other Bit files or projects.
* **Declarations:** Usually functions, structures, classes, etc. are defined here.
* **Run code:** When importing or running, this runs directly. This replaces the "main" functions in other languages.
